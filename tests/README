This directory contains small NIT programs divided in some categories:
* 'base' are minimal and fundamental tests
* 'bench' are memory and time tests
* 'error' are invalid programs
* 'example' are examples 
* 'test' are others tests
* 'shootout' are benchmarks from http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/

The .gitignore contains specific artefacts produced by some tests.
However, it is better to produce these artifacts in the `out` directory instead,
because `out` is cleaned before runing tests (so that old artefacts do not
interfere with new executions of tests)
