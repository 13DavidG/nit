Hello world !
Usage of Strings:

Allocations, by type:
		
	-FlatString = 29
	-FlatBuffer = 2
	-Concat = 0
	-RopeBuffer = 0

Calls to length, by type:
	FlatString = 23 (cache misses 5, 21.73%)
Indexed accesses, by type:
	FlatString = 13
Calls to bytelen for each type:
	FlatString = 61
Calls to position for each type:
	FlatString = 27
Calls to bytepos for each type:
	FlatString = 14
Calls to first_byte on FlatString 216
Calls to last_byte on FlatString 19
FlatStrings allocated with length 78 (86.813%)
Length of travel for index distribution:
* 0 = 16 => occurences 80.0%, cumulative 80.0% 
* 1 = 14 => occurences 35.0%, cumulative 75.0%
