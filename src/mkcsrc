# NAME
#	mkcsrc - generate a new c_src directory from a current nitc bootstrap
# SYNOPSIS
#	./mkcsrc [number]
# DESCRIPTION
#	transform a bootstrap result (generated by the nc tool) into a new
#	c_src in the current directory (previous one will be errased).
#	One c_src generated, you can replace the old one in the root.
#	Before commiting, do not forget to:
#	 * verify any regression
#	 * add/remove files in c_src
# OPTION
#	number is the bootstrap level to use.  It corresponds to the nc
#	level.  By default, the lastest generated nitc is used.
