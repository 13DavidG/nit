## What is Nit?

Nit is an expressive language with a script-like syntax, a friendly type-system and aims at elegance, simplicity and intuitiveness.

Nit has a simple straightforward style and can usually be picked up quickly, particularly by anyone who has programmed before.
While object-oriented, it allows procedural styles.

### Build and Run Programs

In your Dockerfile, write something like:

~~~Dockerfile
FROM nitlang/nit

# Create a workdir
RUN mkdir -p /root/work
WORKDIR /root/work

# Copy the source code in /root/work/
COPY . /root/work/

# Compile
RUN nitc src/hello.nit --dir . \
	# Clear disk space
	&& ccache -C
# You can also use a Makefile or any build system you want.

# Run
CMD ["./hello"]
~~~

Then, build and execute
